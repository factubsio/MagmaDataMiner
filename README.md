Data extraction for Inkbound, greatest game ever made (after Monster Train, unless... 😳👉👈)

No idea if you can build it, it has some yolo paths in the .csproj; you'll need to point them at your Inkbound install.

Also there are some hardcoded paths in the source, they will get cleaned up "in time".

I have no idea what licence is kosher since there is a very very tiny amount of code derived from inkbound's deserializer.

Please don't sue me.
